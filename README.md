# 🚖 **Uber Ride Analysis Dashboard**

## 🎯 **1. Project Objective**
The goal of this project was to analyze one full year of Uber ride activity using SQL, Python and Power BI.  
The main focus was to understand ride demand, cancellations, revenue patterns and the overall quality of drivers and customers.  
This dashboard helps identify how Uber rides behave across time, locations, vehicle types and user behaviour.

## 📊 **2. Key Insights (From the Power BI Dashboard)**  
Here’s a summary of the most important findings:

### ✅ **Ride Completion & Cancellations**
- Out of **150K rides**, around **62% were completed**.  
- **25% rides were cancelled**, with “Cancelled by Driver” being the highest category.  
- **7% rides had ‘No Driver Found’**, mostly during peak hours.

### ⏰ **Demand Trends**
- Ride demand peaks between **5 PM – 8 PM**.  
- Weekends show slightly higher demand compared to weekdays.  
- Monthly rides stay consistent across the year.

### 💰 **Revenue & Fare Patterns**
- **Autos and Go Mini** generate the highest revenue due to high volume.  
- Average Ride Fare is around **₹508**.  
- Average Ride Distance is about **24.6 km**.  
- All vehicle types charge a fairly similar **fare per km** (~₹38/km).

### ⭐ **Ratings**
- **Average customer rating:** 4.40  
- **Average driver rating:** 4.23

## 🛠️ **3. Tech Stack**  

### 🗂️ **SQL (MySQL)**  
Used for **data cleaning and preprocessing**:
- Removed duplicates  
- Fixed data types  
- Created new features (ride hour, weekday, month, ride type)  
- Converted messy values into usable formats  

SQL helped convert raw CSV data into an analysis-ready dataset.

### 🐍 **Python (Pandas + Seaborn/Matplotlib)**  
Used for:
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Detecting outliers  
- Understanding distributions  
- Validating SQL cleaning  

Python helped confirm that the cleaned dataset was correct before moving to Power BI.

### 📊 **Power BI**  
Used to build the **interactive dashboard**.  
Great for:
- KPI tracking  
- Heatmaps  
- Time-series analysis  
- Dynamic filters  
- Clean visual storytelling for business use  

Power BI turned all insights into an easy-to-use dashboard.
